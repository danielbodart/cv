<dd>
    <p><strong>Director, Founder</strong>,
        <a href="http://dan.bodar.com/">Bodar Ltd</a>, London</p>

    <p>I specialise in helping people and technology work well together. My passion is solving problems that are deemed impossible or intractable. I tend to work in a agile style but with as little dogma as possible.</p>

    <p>See below for specific example of the type of clients I work with</p>

<dd>
    <p><strong>Principal Software Engineer</strong>,
        <a href="http://triptease.com/">Triptease</a>, London</p>

    <p>My principle task has been to convert a highly manual development task of integrating new clients and hotels on to the Triptease platform and turn it into a fully automated process using static data analysis, natural language processing, machine learning and human supervision.</p>

    <p>Building probabilistic software is an incredible interesting but challenging space not just from a technical perspective but also from the human side as we must always be mindful of our innate biases that cloud our judgement.</p>

The service's goal is to help scientists and researchers keep abreast of the 4k new articles published every day in science. The project started as an MVP and has continuously experimented both with user features and technology. All features are A/B tested and metrics used to help inform the project direction. The service is holistic approach to product development, UX, visual design, software development and algorithm design where everyone on the team mucks in.</p>
